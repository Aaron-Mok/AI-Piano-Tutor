# AI Piano Tutor – Real-Time Key and Note Detection

This project uses computer vision and audio processing to assist beginner pianists in learning to sight-read. It maps sheet music to real piano key positions in real time using a webcam and microphone.

## How it Works

- Uses YOLOv8 and segmentation technique to detect 52 piano keys from a webcam feed.
- Maps each note from sheet music to a key position.
- Converts microphone input to a spectrogram via FFT and identifies played notes.
- Only advances the score when the correct note or chord is played.

## Technologies

- Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLOv8, PyTorch
- music21 (sheet music parsing)
- FFT (audio frequency analysis)
